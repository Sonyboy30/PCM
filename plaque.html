    <h2>In Honor of Those Who Built the Canal</h2>
    <p>
      This exhibit honors the tens of thousands of workers, engineers, nurses, and families who transformed
      the isthmus into a working waterway between two oceans. Their labor—across languages and nationalities—
      faced landslides, heat, and disease. Guided by new public-health science and bold engineering, they
      forged locks, dams, and a lake that reshaped trade and diplomacy. The Canal’s story reflects the
      Progressive Era’s faith in expertise and infrastructure, as well as the hard truths of inequality
      and sovereignty that marked its creation. May their perseverance and skill continue to inspire
      future builders and citizens.
