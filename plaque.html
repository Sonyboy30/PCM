      <h2>Commemorative Plaque</h2>
      <p>
        This exhibit honors the thousands of men and women from around the world who built the Panama Canal between 1904 and 1914. Through heat, rain, and disease, their collective strength turned a centuries-old dream into a reality that reshaped global trade.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their work embodies the Progressive Era’s faith in innovation and perseverance. It also reminds us of the human cost behind progress—thousands lost their lives to bring the canal into being. This monument stands not only for engineering triumph but for the shared labor and sacrifice that defined it.
